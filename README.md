<h2 align="center"> Flease </h2>

**Flease** is an algorithm for decentralized and fault-tolerant lease coordination in distributed systems. The algorithm allows the processes competing for a resource to coordinate exclusive access through leases among themselves without a central component. The resulting system easily scales with an increasing number of nodes and resources.

This repo is a Golang implementation and you can get more details about the algorithm in the original paper [Fault-tolerant and decentralized lease coordination for distributed systems](https://github.com/KDF5000/flease/blob/master/paper/flease-fault-tolerant-and-decentralized-lease-coordination-for-distributed-systems.pdf)
